## Normal Mode

In normal mode, the player selects their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then the computer randomly picks its choice. The game determines the winner based on the choices made by both the player and the computer. When you start this mode, the first run will show some jokes and a starting Helicopter.

## Crazy Mode

In crazy mode, the computer's choice is already determined. The player is presented with shuffled choices (rock, paper, and scissors) displayed rapidly on the screen. The player must press the spacebar at the right time to select the choice that can beat the computer's choice. The game tests the player's timing and accuracy.

## How to Play

1. Run the Mode you like.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.
3. You will be prompted to play again or exit.
